# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of this file downloader is currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Considerations

### Network Security

1. **SSL/TLS Verification**
   - The downloader uses Windows' built-in certificate validation
   - HTTPS connections are enforced for secure downloads
   - Certificate validation cannot be disabled programmatically

2. **URL Validation**
   - URLs are parsed and validated before connection attempts
   - Host and path components are separated and sanitized
   - Maximum lengths are enforced for URL components

3. **Network Timeouts**
   - Configurable timeouts prevent hanging connections
   - Default timeout values are set to prevent DOS situations
   - Connection attempts are limited and controlled

### File System Security

1. **File Writing**
   - Files are written with minimal required permissions
   - Target directories are validated before writing
   - Existing files are not automatically overwritten without permission
   - Path traversal attempts are blocked

2. **Memory Management**
   - Buffer sizes are strictly controlled
   - Memory is properly allocated and freed
   - Stack buffer overflows are prevented through size checks

### Usage Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated before use
   - URL formats are strictly checked
   - File paths are sanitized
   - Buffer sizes are verified

2. **Error Handling**
   - Errors are caught and handled gracefully
   - No sensitive information is exposed in error messages
   - Failed operations clean up resources properly

## Known Security Limitations

1. The downloader does not:
   - Implement custom certificate pinning
   - Provide built-in file integrity verification
   - Support proxy authentication
   - Implement bandwidth throttling

2. Users should be aware:
   - Downloads are not automatically scanned for malware
   - File permissions inherit from the running process
   - System proxy settings are used by default

## Best Practices for Users

1. **URL Safety**
   - Only download from trusted sources
   - Verify HTTPS is used for all downloads
   - Check URLs carefully before downloading

2. **File Safety**
   - Scan downloaded files with antivirus software
   - Verify file checksums when available
   - Don't run downloaded executables without verification

3. **System Configuration**
   - Run with minimal required permissions
   - Keep Windows and security certificates updated
   - Use system-wide antivirus protection

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. **Do** send a detailed report to [security contact email]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. Please allow up to 90 days for vulnerabilities to be patched before public disclosure.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed:
1. Critical vulnerabilities: Within 7 days
2. High severity: Within 30 days
3. Medium/Low severity: Next regular release

Updates will be distributed through the main repository with detailed changelog entries.

## Building Securely

When building the project:
1. Use the latest compiler version
2. Enable all security flags:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wcast-align -Wuninitialized -Wno-unused-parameter -fno-common -fstack-protector-strong
   ```
3. Link against secure versions of system libraries

## Security-Related Configuration

The following configuration options affect security:
1. `timeout` - Controls connection timeouts
2. `show_progress` - Controls information disclosure
3. File paths - Determine where files can be written

## Dependency Security

1. This project depends on:
   - Windows HTTP API (winhttp.dll)
   - Standard C Runtime

2. Keep these components updated through Windows Update

## Code Signing

1. Release builds should be signed with an appropriate certificate
2. Users should verify signatures before using the downloader
3. Build process includes signature verification steps

## Audit Logging

The downloader supports basic audit logging:
1. Download attempts are logged
2. Failed operations are recorded
3. Security-relevant events are timestamped

## Compliance

This software aims to comply with:
1. OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines
2. Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle
3. Common secure coding practices

## Regular Security Reviews

The codebase undergoes:
1. Regular security reviews
2. Static analysis scanning
3. Dynamic testing when appropriate

## Version Verification

Users can verify they are using a secure version:
1. Check version numbers in source
2. Verify release signatures
3. Compare checksums of binaries
